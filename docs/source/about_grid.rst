About Grid
**********

Hyperledger Grid components include:

- Reference implementations of supply-chain-centric data types, including
  domain-specific data models based on existing open standards such as GS1.

- Smart-contract business logic based on industry best practices.

- Pike, a smart contract that handles organization and identity permissions
  with Sawtooth Sabre.

- SDKs that simplify development for smart contracts, such as the Rust SDK for
  Pike.

- Example smart contracts and applications that show how to combine components
  from the Hyperledger stack into a single, effective business solution. For
  instance, Grid Track and Trace is a smart contract for tracking goods as they
  move through a supply chain.
