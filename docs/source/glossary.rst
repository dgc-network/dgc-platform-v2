Glossary
========

This glossary defines Hyperledger Grid terms and concepts.

.. glossary::

  Distributed ledger
    Distributed database that records transactions, in chronological order,
    shared by all participants in a network. (Also called a `blockchain`.)
    Each block is linked by a cryptographic hash to the previous block.

  Grid Track and Trace
    Smart contract for tracking goods as they move through a supply chain.

  Pike
    Smart contract that handles organization and identity permissions with
    Sawtooth Sabre.

  Sawtooth Sabre
    Smart-contract engine that executes smart contracts with WebAssembly (WASM).
    The rules for a smart contract are defined by a `transaction family`. For
    more information, see the
    `Sabre documentation <https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/nightly/master/>`__.

  Transaction family
    Another term for a `smart contract`: Application-specific business logic
    that defines a set of operations or transaction types that are allowed on
    the distributed ledger. A transaction family implements a data model and
    transaction language for an application.
